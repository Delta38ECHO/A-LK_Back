4/1/2021 - 1pm - [4pm] - Helped Pascual and Sahar make alterations to front end where the myraid of Syntax errors were fixed and pages were able to load and connect to back end.

Current issue - Databse is connected, BUT when making a new account to then push all account data to database; No new information is appearing in mySQL db.
May need to check and put DB into a NormalForm (3NF) such that account_id in Users isn't dependent on itself from Accounts table, thus making the entering of data from front end feaseble.  
ELSE
Need some code wizadry to push data to two tables AT ONCE so that the data isn't ignored by db.  (Will cause deletion anomoly when user account deletion is implemented.)
